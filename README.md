## 🚀 What is RltyChk?

Reality Check (stylized RltyChk) provides a model for investigating climate change on the county level and answers the big question on everyones mind as we enter this brave new world:

How is climate change going to affect buying a home in the future?

As us Millenials and Gen Z'ers become that age and aquire enough wealth to purchase a house, we should most likely avoid some areas that are going to be bad investments (like really bad investments). This model tackles that 'bad investment' scenario by correlating NOAA climate data to housing data. We wanted to look at how big of an issue is climate change going to affect our homes and our lively hood and minimize that as much as possible by selecting a county to live in that is 'climate resiliant'. We can look at this grossly through our 'Liveability Index', which is a weighted algorithm designed to give a quick feedback on whether or not a county is a good place to setlle down.
